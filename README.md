**pfSense Configuration Highlights
- Multiple physical interfaces (1 WAN, 2 LAN), with segmented VLANs:
  - Main VLAN for trusted devices
  - IoT VLAN, VoIP VLAN, IP Camera VLAN, Guest VLAN  
- **Traffic Monitoring:** ntopng integration  
- **VPN:** OpenVPN server for remote access + selective VLAN routing through VPN  
- **Wi-Fi Setup:** Access points mapped to dedicated VLANs for better segmentation


- **Pi-hole Container** ‚Äì Ad blocking & local DNS  
- **Home Assistant VM** ‚Äì  
  - Smart home automation (lights, alarms, Sonos, TVs) using of scripts and Node Red.
  - LED matrix displays for time/date, events, stock prices, notifications
  - Centralized sensors (temperature/humidity, light sensor, motion sensor)
  - MQTT broker (Mosquitto)
  - ZigBee gateway integration
- **Wazuh VM** ‚Äì Monitoring and security event management
